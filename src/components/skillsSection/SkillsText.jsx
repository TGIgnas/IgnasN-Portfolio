        I’m currently working on improving my skills in JavaScript, React, and
        CSS. While I have made significant progress, I recognize that there’s
        still a lot to learn and explore. My understanding of JavaScript is
        growing, and I’m becoming more comfortable with concepts like loops,
        data attributes, and array iteration. In React, I’m actively working on
        building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, especially when
        managing states and props. CSS is another area where I’m enhancing my
        skills, focusing on layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, as well as
        responsive design. I'm committed to continuous improvement and am eager
        to deepen my knowledge in all these areas.
